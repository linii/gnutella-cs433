Description of test cases:

- t1:
- a1 <---> a2
    - simple
    - two nodes
    - have each other as neighbors
    - request 1 file which the other has

- t2 (long)
    - a1 ---> a2 ---> a3 ---> a4 ---> a5
    - 3-5 nodes
    - linked to each other
    - nodes at end of chain request a file that node on other end of chain has

- t3 (slightly more complex)
    - star topology
    - saturated, each node has same size set of neighbors, random request pattern

- t4

- t5
