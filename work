Configuration
    Neighbors config parsing (group membership -- what peers each peer has as its neighbors)
        List of IP addresses + peer ID's
    File config parsing
        List of files peer wants
    Command line parsing (config file,
    Debugging interface (copied from previous assignments)
    Testing:
        Varying topologies
        Text files of various sizes
        Printing of actions (on query, on hitquery, on file request, etc)

Classes
    Peer
    GnutellaPacket (multiplexing and demultiplexing for query/hitquery messages)
        changes structure -> byte[]
        constructs Query message  (message ID, TTL, file name)
        constructs Hitquery message  (message ID, TTL, file name, peer IP, port number)
    AssociativeArray - [message ID, upstream peer ID]
        flushing policy

Peer state
    int peer ID
    DATA STRUCTURE Message IDs + upstream peers
    DATA STRUCTURE local storage / cache
        can be just files stored on machine
    IMMUTABLE DATA STRUCTURE list of neighbors

Query handling - query()
    checking that the message hasn't already been seen
    updating the associative array
    searching local storage
        if file found, sends hitquery message upstream (using hitquery handling function)
    decrement TTL, (increment hops field)
    if TTL is not 0 & not seen already, forwarding to neighbors using TCP socket connection

Hitquery handling - hitquery()
    searching the associative array
    sends hitquery message upstream

File request handling - filerequest()
    specify the port
    listen for connections at that port
    HTTP protocol - file index, file size, file name

Multithreading
    HTTP port - 5760
        upon reception of TCP connection request, accepting TCP connections from upstream for files peer has
    Queries port - 7777
        upon reception of hitquery message, propagating responses back to original sender
        upon reception of query message, sending to neighbors as described above
